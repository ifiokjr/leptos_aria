# leptos_aria

> A port of the `react-aria` ecosystem for the leptos framework.

## Motivation

`leptos` is amazing and still in it's infancy and needs to better support accessibility.

## Contributing

[`devenv`](https://devenv.sh/) is used to provide a reproducible development environment for this
project. Follow the [getting started instructions](https://devenv.sh/getting-started/).

To automatically load the environment you should
[install direnv](https://devenv.sh/automatic-shell-activation/) and then load the `direnv`.

```bash
# The security mechanism didn't allow to load the `.envrc`. 
# Since we trust it, let's allow it execution.
direnv allow .
```

At this point you should see the `nix` commands available in your terminal.
